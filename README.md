ðŸ“§ Email Spam Defender

This is my small project for learning FastAPI, Python, and basic spam detection.
It checks emails, flags spam, and lets you see the results from a web interface.

I made this to practice:

Working with FastAPI for backend APIs

Loading and processing email data in Python

Making a small dashboard to show results

ðŸš€ Features
Load sample emails

Detect spam based on keywords (simple logic)

API to fetch and display emails

Can be connected to a frontend (React or plain HTML)

>>>>>>frontend/            # Optional UI
>>>>>> README.md            # This file

ðŸ›  Installation & Run (Backend only)
1. Clone the repo & Copy code
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Email-Spam-Defender.git
  cd Email-Spam-Defender
2. Create a virtual environment & Copy code
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies & Copy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run FastAPI server& Copy code
    uvicorn dashboard:app --reload
5. Visit in browser
    Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or /docs for API docs).

 ðŸ“Š Example API Routes
  /emails â†’ Get all emails
  
  /spam-stats â†’ See how many are spam
  
  /process-emails â†’ Manually trigger email check

Notes
  This is not a real spam filter â€” itâ€™s a basic keyword-based demo.
  
  For real spam detection, I would use machine learning and better datasets.
  
  This is mainly for learning FastAPI + backend basics.
